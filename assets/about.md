<p class='lead'>I'm Brandan, a fifth-year student graduating from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in December 2023 with an accelerated M.S. in computer science.</p>

I'm most interested in systems programming using low-level C++, but I have a background in robotics and computer vision as well as data science and analytics.

I worked as an undergraduate [research assistant](https://globalcomputing.group/) for two years (with my primary work getting published by IEEE!) and have been a teaching assistant in computer science since January 2021. For years, I've been serving as vice president and programming lead of UTK's competitive VEX U Robotics team. These positions have allowed me to supplement my extensive coursework with additional unique problem solving, communication, and collaboration opportunities through creating effective presentations and data visualizations about my research, breaking down and explaining complex concepts to students, tackling interdisciplinary challenges in robotics, and generally being a part of a large variety of teams throughout my academic career.

I also have valuable industry experience as a software engineer from my Summer 2022 internship with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), where I specialized in backend development. I contributed high-quality code with a strong sense of ownership and understanding of what I was building&mdash;I sought to grasp the system as a whole rather than only work within the scope of my project, considered unit testing and metrics logging, and was able to independently utilize available resources for implementing and debugging my solutions with the best practices. In Summer 2023 during my software engineering internship at [Wabtec](https://www.wabteccorp.com/), I developed and internally deployed a Django web application entirely on my own, gaining more backend knowledge and exposure to designing database schemas and effective user interfaces.

In my free time, I like to practice piano ([one of my current favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxlf-ZmE8JI)) and play video games.
