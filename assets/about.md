<p class='lead'>Hey! I'm Brandan, a fourth-year student graduating from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in December 2022 with an B.S. in computer science and a minor in math.</p>

I'm most interested in systems programming using low-level C++, but I have a background in robotics and computer vision as well as data science and analytics.

I've worked as both an undergraduate [research assistant](https://globalcomputing.group/) and teaching assistant in UTK's CS department since January 2021, so I've been able to supplement my course learnings with additional experience in problem solving, communication, and collaboration by breaking down and explaining complex concepts to students, creating effective presentations and data visualizations about my work, and being a part of a large variety of teams throughout my academic career.

I also have valuable industry experience as a software engineer from my Summer 2022 internship with [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), and I specialize in backend development. I contributed high-quality code with a strong sense of ownership and understanding of what I was building&mdash;I sought to grasp the system as a whole rather than only work within the scope of my project, considered unit testing and logging, and was able to independently utilize available resources for implementing and debugging my solutions with the best practices.

In my free time, I serve as vice president and programming lead of UTK's competitive VEX U Robotics team, practice piano ([one of my current favorites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxlf-ZmE8JI)), and play video games.
