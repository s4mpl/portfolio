### Intro
The goal of this project was basically to create a box from 3D printing or laser cutting. I chose to do laser cutting because I wanted mine to be made of wood, it gave me more flexibility with what I could do without having to model it beforehand, I wanted to gain some more experience with woodworking, and laser cutters are cool.

Today marks the start of μProject 2 for me. I played around with a recommended online box designer for a while and came up with an idea of what I was looking for. I went to Hobby Lobby to buy my wood, but the closest I was able to find was a 36"x6"x1/4" (LxWxH) board of basswood. I wasn't going to make another trip over there for a while, so I settled on that and decided I might try to split the cuts, since there was not enough width to use the entire website-generated cutout at once. Then I went next door to [Woodcraft](https://www.woodcraft.com/stores/knoxville) and got these hinges for the lid and a nice little matching latch to keep the box closed.

I experimented with many different ideas and box dimensions again using the website, measuring various items and thinking about how I might want to store them in my box. I decided I would make it 10"x5"x5", where the lid was 2 inches (of the 5) tall, and my dividers would be separately cut and glued in. That way, I could play around with different arrangements of dividers that were more flexible instead of the same-size grid dividers the website created. Also, in the end it wasn't feasible to have the dividers laser cut too as it required way too big of a board&mdash;and way too big of a laser cutter.

After mapping out my separate cuts, I realized that they still would not all fit on my board (looking at the dimensions of the SVG in Inkscape), so I cut it down to 9.5"x4.5"x5", where the lid was still 2 inches tall. At this point, the whole cut for the lid actually did fit on my current board, so I decided I would work with that in the meantime and go buy another board soon.

I went and bought more wood from Hobby Lobby, and luckily I found some birch plywood that was 36"x8"x1/4". This meant I could fit my cut for the bottom half entirely on a board as well! I bought two of those just in case anything went wrong as I was near the (original) due date. The new design required 23.75"x6.125" of area (23.5"x6" if I used the more compact option, but I didn't notice it at the time), which was just within the 24" maximum length for the laser cutter I had access to. I also bought a smaller thinner board that I planned to make the dividers out of.

I went into the [ICS](https://innovate.utk.edu/) with my wood and designs ready-to-go on a flash drive, but I encountered two major challenges:
1. My board was 36" long, so I had to use a bandsaw in the woodshop to cut it down to 24"&mdash;which I learned was a very hard limit shortly after I cut my first board down to 26", wanting to leave some room on the sides, so I had to shorten it further and was dangerously close to the 23.75" I needed&mdash;before I was able to start my laser cut. The last time I had used a bandsaw was in 7th grade (about 9 years ago!) so I had to get accustomed to using one again.
2. The software didn't like my files for whatever reason, so I needed to export my design again from Adobe Illustrator on their computers.

With that out of the way, ... friendly ICS assistant Kai helped me calibrate the machine and prepare ... jog ...
While waiting, I went and prepared my other board and design.

I went back to the ICS to clean up the two pieces that didn't come out right, as well as to cut my dividers on a bandsaw. To my surprise, the wood I bought for this happened to already be the right width, so that saved me a fair amount of trouble.

Made pilot holes and screwed hinges on and latch on

It wasn't until after I screwed the latch on that I realized there was a hole made for it to go into, not under. (reword)

Tried to sand down the screws. Now not as sharp, but still not great. I will try to use it.

My box saw its first use&mdash;I used it to carry around my miniProject 1 without having to disassemble it. (reword) I discovered my mistake actually turned out to be quite a useful feature&mdash;I can squeeze a bit of additional storage into my box and still have it close!
