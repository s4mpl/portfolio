### Intro
This class, a new upper-division special topics elective titled "Interactive Technologies in Human-Computer Interaction," has an interesting approach to documentation for our larger-scale projects. Instead of just writing reports, we get to do it through a more casual and fitting medium: a blog! I am writing with reproducibility and refinement in mind&mdash;I lay out all the steps I took and make note of things I wish I had done differently or could have known to do for a better outcome, so if I ever did this again in the future (or if you wanted to follow along ðŸ™‚), the post would hopefully be beneficial. Failure is one of the best teachers.

> Fail early and fail often.
