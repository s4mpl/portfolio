### Intro
This class, a new upper-division special topics elective titled "Interactive Technologies in Human-Computer Interaction," is geared towards computer science students with no prior experience with hands-on projects involving microcontrollers or any real background in electronics. It aims to teach the skills necessary to design and prototype small electronic devices using simple parts that would allow the user to interact with a program through physical actions, and it has an interesting approach to documentation for our larger-scale projects. Instead of just writing reports, we get to do it through a more casual and fitting medium: a blog! I am writing with reproducibility and refinement in mind&mdash;I lay out all the steps I took and make note of things I wish I had done differently or could have known to do for a better outcome, so if I ever did this again in the future (or if you wanted to follow along ðŸ™‚), the post would hopefully be beneficial. Failure is one of the best teachers.
