### Intro
This class has an interesting element of documentation of our larger-scale projects, but this is done through a more casual and fitting medium: a blog! This is being written with the ideas of reproducibility and refinement in mind&mdash;I lay out all the steps I took and make note of things I wish I could have done differently or changed for a better outcome, so if I ever did this again in the future (or if you wanted to follow along ðŸ™‚), the post would hopefully be beneficial. Failure is one of the best teachers.

> Fail early and fail often.
