> **DISCLAIMER:** This was a five-person group project, and it certainly would not have gotten done without the respectable efforts of most of my teammates. However, I would like to take credit for a majority of the work aside from the starred bullet points below. :-)

This operating system runs in QEMU and targets the RISC-V architecture. It is written in C and boasts the following features:
* page-grained physical memory allocation
* RISC-V Sv39 MMU (39-bit virtual addresses, 56-bit physical addresses)
  * separate address spaces for the kernel heap and each process' stack and heap
* PCIe memory-mapped I/O
* drivers for the following VirtIO devices:
  * random number generator*
  * keyboard input*
  * tablet input
  * block devices (to mount `.dsk` files to)
  * GPU (drawing rectangles, circles, and strings from a bitmap font)
* Minix 3 file system*
* processes and round-robin scheduling*
* runnable ELF files loadable from the file system
* support for user space applications, including system calls
  * currently runs a primitive version of MS Paint that allows for drawing with a fixed set of colors and sizes, saving a selection of the screen as a PPM image, and pasting an existing PPM image from the file system

The `README.md` file included in the [repository](https://github.com/s4mpl/cs562) is a journal of the project's progress and highlights most of the major bugs and challenges we overcame. I don't have access to the original commit history, so unfortunately that is gone forever.

Here's a small showcase of the user space application in action:

Admittedly not a very professional theme (so I've avoided marketing it such), but we were having a lot of fun with it and did a play on words with the game *Among Us* and arrived at...
