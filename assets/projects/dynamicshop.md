<hr>
This is a server plugin for Minecraft that would allow players to interact with a global market through chat commands. So every item has a buy and sell price, every player has a balance, and there’s even a leaderboard showing all current player balances, though this is all pretty standard. The twist is that every item has this exponential curve that its price follows based on how many have been bought and sold, creating an economy based on supply and demand. Players can list the highest or lowest percent changes in price in the market to see if there’s an opportunity to make money or to avoid buying certain artificially scarce items, and it’s been working very well.
