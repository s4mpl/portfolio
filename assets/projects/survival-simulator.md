My last big project is from this summer. I was creating a top-down 2D shooter game inspired by one I made for my high school computer science final project, but much better. I coded it in C++ using the SFML library for graphics and implemented the physics and collision-handling myself on day one. Then I created the player and added weapons and interactive objects. Bullets could ricochet and some projectiles followed the player or the mouse. I enjoyed working on it and was proud of how it was turning out after only a week.
